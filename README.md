# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-WITH-IBM

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
You needs `python 3` to run this code.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
In this project I used different approaches of recommendation systems to recommend to users of the IBM platform articles to read.

1) Rank-based Recommendations
I recommended articles to users based on how often that article was interacted with.

2) Collaborative Filtering
We could look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users.

3) Matrix Factorization
Here I used a machine learning approach to recommending articles to users. I used Singular Value Decomposition to create a training and test set. I then made predictions in both sets using a range of different number of latent features.
